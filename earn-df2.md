Ocean Data Farming (DF) is Ocean's incentives program. There are weekly OCEAN rewards for various activities.

The main Predictoor-based way to earn from DF is to become a predictoor, and earn directly from [Predictoor DF](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/predictoordf).

Good news! Even if youâ€™re not active as a predictoor, you can nonetheless earn with DF. Here's how:

* **[Passive DF](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/passivedf).** By simply locking your OCEAN for veOCEAN, you can earn passive rewards.  
* **[Volume DF](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/data-farming/volumedf).** Point the veOCEAN to data assets with high data consume volume (DCV). Predictoor feeds are great candidates for high-DCV assets.
